This is a project to import data about charities from governments around the world into Wikidata. 

These are the importers currently working:

- IRS pub 78 (US)

There is a [SPARQL query](https://github.com/cloutier/wikidata-nonprofits-importer/blob/master/foundations.sparql) to see what data is currently there on wikidata.
